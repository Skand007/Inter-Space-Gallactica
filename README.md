# Inter-Space-Gallactica
This is my first python project. It's a multi-plyer game which involves 2 players at once. It is based on the pygame module.
It was inspired by the old and retro games that I used to play with in early age of computers. The graphics used thus might remind you of an old version of the current age.
I will keep making changes in this as time progresses along with making other new and exciting things on un-discovered topics for me.




THANK YOU!!!
